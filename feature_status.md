## Technical Architecture

### Core Systems
- **Turn-Based Game Loop**: Player input → World update → Entity actions → Render
- **Event System**: Decoupled communication between game systems
- **Entity Component System**: Flexible entity management
- **Terminal Abstraction**: Testable rendering layer
- **State Management**: Centralized game state with save/load
- **Action Queue**: Turn order and action resolution system

### Performance Requirements
- **Turn Resolution**: < 100ms for responsive gameplay
- **Entity Count**: Support 100+ active entities per turn
- **Memory**: < 500MB RAM usage
- **Rendering**: Partial updates only (no full redraws)
- **Input Response**: Immediate input acknowledgment
- **AI Processing**: All entity decisions within turn budget

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Test Coverage**: > 80%
- **Integration Tests**: Full game loop testing
- **Performance Tests**: Automated benchmarks
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing on push

## Known Issues

- None yet (new project)
