## Contributing

This project uses PlayTest-Driven Development. Please ensure:
1. Tests are sometimes written before implementing features
   but playtesting is more important because good playing is the most important
   important feature.
1.5 prefer writing unit tests to single file test scripts for code coverage.
2. Try to maintain >80% code coverage
2.5 Good playing is more important than good unit testing, but unit testing is important
   for concrete things and can be managed and organized easier than other types of testing.
3. Run performance benchmarks
4. Update this status document
5. Follow the TDD workflow in workflow.md if the feature warrants it, but remember good playing is the most important
   feature so don't let tests stop you from making the game good. 
6. Thank you in advance. You are important.
