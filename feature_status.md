## Technical Architecture

### Project Structure
```
src/magemines/
├── core/          # Foundation (terminal, events, state)
├── game/          # Game logic (loop, map, entities)
├── ui/            # UI components (messages, header, overlays)
└── __main__.py    # Entry point
```

### Architectural Strengths (from Code Review)
- Clean, modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Robust terminal abstraction layer enabling comprehensive testing
- Feature-rich UI with color support, scrollable message pane, and loading indicators
- Sophisticated procedural map generation with multiple algorithms
- Excellent terminal rendering optimization (partial updates only)
- Strong testing infrastructure with both unit and integration tests
- Event-driven architecture foundation in place

### Areas for Improvement (from Code Review)
- Missing service layer for AI/OpenAI integration
- No clear data/persistence layer
- Configuration scattered across modules
- Monolithic game_loop.py (225 lines) needs refactoring
- Large map_generator.py (800+ lines) needs splitting
- Many ad-hoc test files need organization
- No seed management for reproducible generation
- Missing error recovery mechanisms

### Core Systems
- **Turn-Based Game Loop**: Player input → World update → Entity actions → Render
- **Event System**: Decoupled communication between game systems  
- **Entity Component System**: Placeholder - needs full implementation
- **Terminal Abstraction**: Testable rendering layer
- **State Management**: Centralized game state (save/load not implemented)
- **Action Queue**: Turn order and action resolution system (not implemented)

### Performance Requirements
- **Turn Resolution**: < 100ms for responsive gameplay
- **Entity Count**: Support 100+ active entities per turn
- **Memory**: < 500MB RAM usage
- **Rendering**: Partial updates only (no full redraws)
- **Input Response**: Immediate input acknowledgment
- **AI Processing**: All entity decisions within turn budget

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Test Coverage**: > 80%
- **Integration Tests**: Full game loop testing
- **Performance Tests**: Automated benchmarks
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing on push

### Testing Infrastructure Status
- Good unit test coverage for core systems
- Terminal abstraction enables UI testing without real terminal
- **Issue**: Many ad-hoc test files in root test directory need organization
- **Recommendation**: Move experimental tests to `tests/playground/` or `tests/experiments/`
- Missing performance benchmarks despite requirements

## Known Issues

### Fixed Issues
- ~~Recursion depth error when going below certain dungeon levels~~ **FIXED** (2025-07-25)
  - Converted recursive flood fill algorithms to iterative approach using deque
  - Tested successfully up to level 30 and with 100x100 maps

### Critical Issues (from Code Review)
1. **Memory Management**: LevelManager keeps all visited levels in memory indefinitely
   - **Solution**: Implement LRU cache for levels, serialize distant levels to disk
   
2. **Missing Core Gameplay**: Current implementation is a dungeon crawler without god-game mechanics
   - **Priority**: Entity Component System → Basic mage AI → Divine intervention → Resources → Combat
   
3. **Error Handling**: Many functions lack proper error handling
   - File I/O operations, terminal operations, map generation edge cases need attention
   
4. **Performance Concerns**:
   - No profiling or optimization for large maps
   - Dijkstra's algorithm used for all connectivity checks
   - No spatial partitioning for entity queries

### Immediate Priorities (Next Sprint - from Review)
1. **Implement Entity Component System**
   - Create base Entity class with components
   - Position, Renderable, AI, Inventory components
   - Entity manager with spatial indexing

2. **Basic Mage AI**
   - Simple need-based AI (hunger, safety, exploration)
   - A* pathfinding implementation
   - Task queue system

3. **Divine Intervention Framework**
   - Spell targeting system
   - Area-of-effect calculations
   - Mana/divine power resource

4. **Configuration System**
   - Centralized game settings
   - Difficulty parameters
   - Debug options

## Project Summary

**Current Status**: Phases 1-3 Completed (Foundation, UI, World Generation)

**Strengths**: The project has a solid technical foundation with clean architecture, robust UI components, and sophisticated map generation. The terminal rendering is well-optimized, and the testing infrastructure is comprehensive.

**Key Gap**: The core "god-game" mechanics are missing. The current implementation is essentially a dungeon crawler without the unique gameplay that would make it a compelling god-game experience.

**Next Steps**: Focus should shift immediately to implementing the Entity Component System and basic mage AI to bring the game concept to life.

## Contributing

This project uses PlayTest-Driven Development. Please ensure:
1. Tests are sometimes written before implementing features
   but playtesting is more important because good playing is the most important
   important feature.
1.5 prefer writing unit tests to single file test scripts for code coverage.
2. Try to maintain >80% code coverage
2.5 Good playing is more important than good unit testing, but unit testing is important
   for concrete things and can be managed and organized easier than other types of testing.
3. Run performance benchmarks
4. Update this status document
5. Follow the TDD workflow in workflow.md if the feature warrants it, but remember good playing is the most important
   feature so don't let tests stop you from making the game good. 
6. Thank you in advance. You are important.
